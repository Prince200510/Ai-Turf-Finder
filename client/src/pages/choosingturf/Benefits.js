            <h1>ðŸŒ¿ Benefits of Turf</h1>
            <p>
            Playing on a well-maintained turf offers numerous advantages. It provides a smooth and safe playing surface, reducing the risk of injuries compared to traditional grounds. Turf fields are designed to withstand all weather conditions, ensuring year-round playability without worrying about muddy or uneven surfaces. They also require minimal maintenance, making them a cost-effective and sustainable choice. Additionally, artificial turf enhances game performance by offering consistent ball bounce and grip, making it a preferred choice for sports enthusiasts and professionals alike.

                    <li>Is good for mental health.</li>
                    <li>200 m2 of natural turf provides enough oxygen for 12 to 18 people each day.</li>
                    <li>A good lawn can increase the value of your home up to $75,000.</li>
                    <li>250 square metres of lawn can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release enough oxygen for a family of four.</li>
                    <li>Turfgrass absorbs heat and breaks up radiant energy. An average size lawn of a house has the cooling effect of about 9 tonnes of air conditioning.</li>
                    <li>On a hot day, a grass lawn will be at least 15Â°C cooler than asphalt and 8Â°C cooler than bare soil. Studies have shown that artifical or synthetic turf is 19Â°C to 28Â°C (up to 3 times) higher in surface temperature than natural turf (Robinson, 1996).</li>
                    <li>Is cooler and softer to play sport on than artificial turfgrass.</li>
                    <li>Turfgrass reduces glare and is also effective in reducing noise.</li>
                    <li>Helps maintain a balanced ecosystem.</li>
